- [Installation](#installation)
- [Development Workflow](#development-workflow)

## Installation

**1. Include autocomplete.js:**

```<script src="autocomplete.js"></script>
```


**2. Create an instance and bind it to your input element:**


> :information_source: Something.


**3. Use your own CSS styles:**

```
persoo-autocompleteDropdown_root
```

> You're done installing! Now let's get started developing.



## Development Workflow

Or checkout this repository and modify it as you want to.

**4. Start a live-reload development server:**

```sh
npm run dev
```

> This is a full web server nicely suited to your project. Any time you make changes within the `src` directory, it will rebuild and even refresh your browser.

**5. Testing with `mocha`, `karma`, `chai`, `sinon` via `phantomjs`:**

```sh
npm test
```

**6. Generate a production build in `./build`:**

```sh
npm run build
```


**5. Start local production server with `superstatic`:**

```sh
npm start
```

> This is to simulate a production (CDN) server with gzip. It just serves up the contents of `./build`.
